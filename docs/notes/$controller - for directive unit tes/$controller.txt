$controller
- has $controllerProvider
- it is service in module ng
$controller service is responsible for instantiating controllers.

It's just a simple call to $injector, but extracted into a service, 
so that one can override this service with BC (outdated controller) version.

Dependencies: $injector


Usage: $controller(constructor, locals);

@param: constructor	
type: function() OR string	
details: If called with a function then it's considered to be the controller 
constructor function. Otherwise it's considered to be a string which is used 
to retrieve the controller constructor using the following steps:
check if a controller with given name is registered via $controllerProvider
check if evaluating the string on the current scope returns a constructor
if $controllerProvider#allowGlobals, check window[constructor] on the 
global window object (not recommended)
The string can use the controller as property syntax, where the controller 
instance is published as the specified property on the scope; the scope must 
be injected into locals param for this to work correctly.

@param: locals	
type: Object	
details: Injection locals for Controller.


@eturn
type: Object	
details: Instance of given controller.
