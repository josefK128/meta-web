Some css3d templates are a refactored and minimal responsive design
whereas others are in original sometimes irregular form but kept for
custom hand-refined effects and not worth reinterpreting in the new form. 

compact-responsive:
base-skycube - general and designed for shot-sequence GSAP animation
base-skycube-rotate - general basic rotation animation
base-skycube-descent - float down and ascend back

custom:
base-skycube-stratos - specific to sky-like textures
base-skycube-rotatewarp - nice abstract paths - suitable for extremal anim
interactive/base-skycube-i - mouse spinnable and with depth dolly - mountains
